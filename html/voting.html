                <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party is a political party in India and one of the two major Indian political parties alongside the Indian National Congress.

The BJP is aligned with right-wing politics and has close ideological and organisational links to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) volunteer paramilitary organisation. Its policies adhere to Hindutva, a Hindu nationalist ideology. As of December 2023, it is the country's biggest political party in terms of representation in the Parliament of India as well as state legislatures.</p>

                <h2>Indian National Congress</h2><br>
                <p> The Indian National Congress (INC), colloquially the Congress Party or simply the Congress, is a political party in India with widespread roots. Founded in 1885, it was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa. From the late 19th century, and especially after 1920, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement. The Congress led India to independence from the United Kingdom, and significantly influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire.</p>
